<h1>Overview</h1>

This project comprises two distinct eye-tracking experiments that investigate the effects of label saliency (anti-saliency effect) in consumer decision-making. One experiment focuses on nutritional labels, while the other examines sustainability labels. Our aim is to explore how increased label visibility influences consumer behavior in different contexts.

<h2>Description</h2>

The repository contains datasets, code, and analytical tools used to conduct and analyze two separate studies. Each study explores the impact of label salience on consumer engagement, one in the context of nutritional information and the other in the realm of sustainability.

<h2>Key Components</h2>

Nutritional Label Study: Scripts and data related to the pre-processing and analysis of how label salience and fasting conditions affect attention to nutritional labels.

Sustainability Label Study: Scripts and data related to the pre-processing and analysis of consumer responses to the salience of sustainability labels.

<h2>Research Objectives</h2>

Nutritional Label Experiment: To empirically test if an increase in calorie label salience, particularly under fasting conditions, leads to avoidance behavior.

Sustainability Label Experiment: To investigate if heightened salience of sustainability labels influences consumer engagement and decision-making.
